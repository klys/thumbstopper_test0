4. Explain how you would make a copy of our production codebase so that you can begin
developing a new feature from a project plan and how you would share your work with
the world as production software. Please use exact commands for starting your work,
preparing for review, and getting it deployed.

Starting with getting the project from thumbstopper repository using git or maven or svn, (in this case git) and then saving the changes.

mkdir project_777
cd project_777
git init
git remote add origin https://thumbstopper.io/repository/project_777
git pull origin master
git checkout -b new-feature
git add *
git commit -m "some testeable part of new feature"
git push origin new-feature

Later on i will create a docker file for the respective project settings or just run the project using docker run command as following

docker pull laravel/php
docker run -p 80 -v ./project_777:/app laravel/php

Its of course depend on project settings, framework, architecture, because a more complex project maybe with a database on postgres, api
